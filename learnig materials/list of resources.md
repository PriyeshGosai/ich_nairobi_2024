# Knowledge Database
The file puts together data sources which can be used for learning energy systems modeling.

## Ecosystem
- *PyPSA* is a backbone power modeling framework https://github.com/pypsa/pypsa
- *PyPSA-Earth* is a model for power or energy system for any country of the world https://github.com/pypsa-meets-earth/pypsa-earth
- *PyPSA-Eur* is a model for power or energy system for countries in Europe https://github.com/pypsa/pypsa-eur
- *atlite* is a library for converting weather data (e.g. wind speeds, solar influx) into data relevant for energy systems https://github.com/pypsa/atlite
- *linopy* https://github.com/PyPSA/linopy
- *technology-data* is a tool which compiles assumptions on energy system technologies (such as costs, efficiencies, lifetimes, etc.) for chosen years (e.g. [2020, 2030, 2050]) from a variety of sources into CSV files to be read by energy system modelling software https://github.com/PyPSA/technology-data
- *powerplantmatching*  is a toolset for cleaning, standardizing and combining multiple open power plant databases https://github.com/PyPSA/powerplantmatching
