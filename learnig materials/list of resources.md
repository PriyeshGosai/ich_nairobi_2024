# Knowledge Database
The file puts together data sources which can be used for getting started with energy systems modeling.

## Software

### Source code
- **PyPSA** is a backbone power modeling framework https://github.com/pypsa/pypsa
- **PyPSA-Earth** is a model for power or energy system for any country of the world https://github.com/pypsa-meets-earth/pypsa-earth
- **PyPSA-Eur** is a model for power or energy system for countries in Europe https://github.com/pypsa/pypsa-eur
- **PyPSA-Distribution** is an optimization model for micro-grids and distribution grids with an automated extraction of the inputs needed to build grid topology and electricity load profiles https://github.com/pypsa-meets-earth/pypsa-distribution
- **atlite** is a library for converting weather data (e.g. wind speeds, solar influx) into data relevant for energy systems https://github.com/pypsa/atlite
- **linopy** is an interface between the model definition and a solver https://github.com/PyPSA/linopy
- **technology-data** is a tool which compiles assumptions on energy system technologies (such as costs, efficiencies, lifetimes, etc.) for chosen years (e.g. [2020, 2030, 2050]) from a variety of sources into CSV files to be read by energy system modelling software https://github.com/PyPSA/technology-data
- **powerplantmatching**  is a toolset for cleaning, standardizing and combining multiple open power plant databases https://github.com/PyPSA/powerplantmatching
